# Welcome to DTBcreate
DTBcreate is to convert different types of database files such as
 - FCC databases (list of U.S. radio amateurs)
 - CRTC databases (list of Canadian radio amateurs)
 - any space delimited ASCII text file

to a binary Win-Test database file (DTB).

## Input files
Please note: These information may change fast. Please take it with care.

### FCC database
Source: _ftp://wirelessftp.fcc.gov/pub/uls/complete/l_amat.zip_

By default, the only file of interest is the _EN.dat_. The columns of this file are separated by '|' characters. The columns of interest are
 - Call sign between 4th and 5th "|" and
 - State between 17th und 18th "|"

This file ist structured like this (first two lines of EN.dat as example):
<pre>
EN|215000|||AA0A|L|L00209566|MC CARTHY, DENNIS J|DENNIS|J|MC CARTHY|||||5022 LANSDOWNE AVE|SAINT LOUIS|MO|63109|||000|0002274249|I|||

</pre>

### CRTC database
Source: _http://apc-cap.ic.gc.ca/datafiles/amateur.zip_

The file of interest is _amateur.txt_. It's a plain ASCI text file, too. Each record (= line) is in the following format:
<pre>

 Club Postal/ZIP Code                 463        7
</pre>
DTBcreate reads only callsign from column 1 (length 6) and province column 187 (length 2). If there's no province avaliable at column 187, the tool has another try at column 460.

There's a special treatment of stations from NL (VO1/VO2):
 - Treat VO1 in NL as NF
 - Treat VO2 in NL as LB

Example record from amateur.rpt:
<pre>
VA1AA  Bill                                McFadden                            188 MILLWOOD DRIVE                                                     LOWER SACKVILLE                     NS B4E 2X8    A B   D
</pre>
### Space delimited text file
Any tabular text file with the format "Call Number" can be converted to a Win-Test DTB.
Examples:
 - A line "DK9VZ F27" will create a DTB entry with callsign=DK9VZ and number=F27.
 - A line "DL2ARD X28 Z88" will create a DTB entry with callsign=DL2ARD and number=X28.
